import Dispatch

/// A future models reading a value which may become available at some point.
///
/// A `FutureType` may be preferable to an architecture using completion
/// handlers; separating the mechanism for handling the completion from the call
/// that began it leads to a more readable code flow.
///
/// A future is primarily useful as a joining mechanism for asynchronous
/// operations. Though the protocol requires a synchronous accessor, its use is
/// not recommended outside of testing. `upon` is preferred for nearly all access:
///
///     myFuture.upon(dispatch_get_main_queue()) { value in
///       print("I now have the value: \(value)")
///     }
///
/// `FutureType` makes no requirement on conforming types regarding thread-safe
/// access, though ideally all members of the future could be called from any
/// thread.
///
public protocol FutureType {
    /// A type that represents the result of some asynchronous operation.
    typealias Value

    /// Call some function once the value is determined.
    ///
    /// If the value is already determined, the function will be submitted to the
    /// queue immediately. An `upon` call is always executed asynchronously.
    ///
    /// - parameter queue: A dispatch queue for executing the given function on.
    /// - parameter body: A function that uses the determined value.
    func upon(queue: dispatch_queue_t, body: Value -> ())

    /// Waits synchronously for the value to become determined.
    ///
    /// If the value is already determined, the call returns immediately with the
    /// value.
    ///
    /// - parameter time: A length of time to wait for the value to be determined.
    /// - returns: The determined value, if filled within the timeout, or `nil`.
    func wait(time: Timeout) -> Value?
