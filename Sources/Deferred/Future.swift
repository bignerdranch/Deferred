/// A future models reading a value which may become available at some point.
///
/// A `FutureProtocol` may be preferable to an architecture using completion
/// handlers; separating the mechanism for handling the completion from the call
/// that began it leads to a more readable code flow.
///
/// A future is primarily useful as a joining mechanism for asynchronous
/// operations. Though the protocol requires a synchronous accessor, its use is
/// not recommended outside of testing. `upon` is preferred for nearly all access:
///
///     myFuture.upon(.main) { value in
///       print("I now have the value: \(value)")
///     }
///
/// `FutureProtocol` makes no requirement on conforming types regarding thread-safe
/// access, though ideally all members of the future could be called from any
/// thread.
///

    /// If the value is determined, the closure should be submitted to the
    /// `executor` immediately.

    /// not unnecessarily block in order to to return.

    func peek() -> Value?

    /// Waits synchronously for the value to become determined.
    ///
    /// If the value is already determined, the call returns immediately with
    /// the value.
