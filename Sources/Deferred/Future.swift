/// A future is primarily useful as a joining mechanism for asynchronous
/// operations. Though the protocol requires a synchronous accessor, its use is
/// not recommended outside of testing. `upon` is preferred for nearly all access:

///     myFuture.upon(.main) { value in
///       print("I now have the value: \(value)")

/// access, though ideally all members of the future could be called from any
/// thread.
