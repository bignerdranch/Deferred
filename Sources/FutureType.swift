/// A `FutureType` may be preferable to an architecture using completion
/// handlers; separating the mechanism for handling the completion from the call
/// that began it leads to a more readable code flow.
///
/// A future is primarily useful as a joining mechanism for asynchronous
/// operations. Though the protocol requires a synchronous accessor, its use is
/// not recommended outside of testing. `upon` is preferred for nearly all access:
///
///     myFuture.upon(dispatch_get_main_queue()) { value in
///       print("I now have the value: \(value)")
///     }
///
/// `FutureType` makes no requirement on conforming types regarding thread-safe
/// access, though ideally all members of the future could be called from any
/// thread.
///
