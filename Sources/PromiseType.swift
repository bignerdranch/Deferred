/// A promise models writing the result of some asynchronous operation.

/// Promises should generally only be determined, or "filled", once. This allows
/// an implementing type to clear a queue of subscribers, for instance, and
/// provides consistent sharing of the determined value.
///
/// An implementing type should discourage race conditions around filling.
/// However, certain use cases inherently race (such as cancellation), and any
/// attempts to check for programmer error should be active by default.
